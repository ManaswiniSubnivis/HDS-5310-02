Statistical Analysis of HIV Testing using the NHANES datasets(Group Project)
Conducted statistical analysis using NHANES datasets: Utilized RStudio and various packages (tidyverse, rlang, ggplot, haven) to clean, pre-process, and analyze data on HIV prevalence rates among NHANES participants.}
Employed diverse analysis techniques: Generated histograms, bar plots, and box plots to explore correlations between independent variables and HIV testing. Applied chi-squared test, Cramer's V, and standardized residuals to determine independence and significant differences across genders.
Examined age groups and HIV testing: Utilized independent-sample t-test to compare HIV testing rates among different age groups, gaining insights into variations in testing behavior.
Utilized logistic regression modeling: Developed a logistic regression model to assess the association between age, sex, marital status, race, and HIV testing. Determined the impact of these factors on the probability of HIV testing.
Provided valuable insights: Findings from the study shed light on factors influencing HIV testing behavior, highlighting the significance of age, gender, marital status, and race in determining the likelihood of testing.
